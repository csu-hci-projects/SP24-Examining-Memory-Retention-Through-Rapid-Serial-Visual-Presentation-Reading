Sarah was walking home from school when she spotted a tiny 4 month old kitten hiding under a bush. Feeling sorry for the frightened creature, she scooped it up and took it home. She made a cozy bed for it in her room and over the next few days, she took care of the kitten, naming it Whiskers. However, one day, the cat disappeared from her room. Panicked, she searched everywhere for her beloved kitten. Eventually, she found it hiding in the garage. Relieved and happy, she promised to never let it wander off again.
