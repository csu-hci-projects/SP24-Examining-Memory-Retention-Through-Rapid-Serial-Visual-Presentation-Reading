One night, while camping in the backyard, Timmy spotted a bright light streaking across the sky. Curious, he followed the light and discovered a small spaceship crash-landed in the woods. Inside the spaceship was Zain, a friendly alien from a distant planet. Despite their initial fear, the two quickly became friends, sharing stories and teaching each other about their worlds. With his help, they repaired his spaceship, and before leaving, he gave him a special teleporter crystal as a token of their friendshipâ€”a reminder of the incredible adventure they shared.
